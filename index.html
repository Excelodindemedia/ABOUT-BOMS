     school god mother is our humble leader, no other person but King Ezege the first of AEB department. Her closest friends

    department and we are solidly behind her.</P>
    <h2>CAREER</h2>
    She and her childhood friend chef Dammy are business partners as per dem dey go catering services together. i have never
     eaten any of her delicacy before sha even after she chop mt spaghetti the last time but its all good. she also does other side gigs 
     like distribution of brownies, like the one that they put igbo inside, lemao. but the market is moving, so all hustle.  BTW,
    I used to be the manager of her brand; THE FOOD AVENUE that is before she unlawfully sacked me.
    <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
    Wo, I do not really know what she likes sef actually, but i know she likes instagram, Jesus christ, you dey always see her everywhere 
    for everybody post. but I thinks she loves dogs, music, probably food, those are the things at the top of my head and above all she loves 
    cooking. if you help her cook food for client,you are on your own because she no go pay you. Ask Excel for first hand experience.
